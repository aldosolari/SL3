# Rules

1. You can use any programming language, but the results must be reproducible. 

2. By the deadline, you should send me a **.txt file** (named "[badge number]\_VS.txt") containing the selected variables in the format
\begin{verbatim}
1  2  8 10 11 12 ...
\end{verbatim}
and a **.pdf file** (named "[badge number]\_VS\_SUPPL.pdf") containing the code to reproduce your results.

3. Deadline: December 10, 2021 h 17:00

# Supplementary code to reproduce the results

```{r}
PATH <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aldosolari/SL3/main/docs/"
yX = read.csv2(paste0(PATH,"VS.csv"))
model = lm( y ~ . , yX )
S = as.numeric(which(summary(model)$coefficients[-1,4] < 0.1))
head(S)
# write.table(file="2575_PI_LOW.txt", PI, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```
