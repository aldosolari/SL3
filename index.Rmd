## Program

**Conformal prediction**

While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in recent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making. Deploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating and communicating the *uncertainty* of predictions. 
We will introduce a recent line of work called distribution-free predictive inference (a.k.a. *conformal prediction*) that give prediction intervals with finite-sample statistical guarantees for any (possibly incorrectly specified) predictive model and any (unknown) underlying distribution of the data, ensuring reliable uncertainty quantification for predictions.

**Variable selection with statistical guarantees**

In many fields of science, we observe a response variable together with a large number of potential explanatory variables, and we would like to be able to discover which predictors are important for the response. We will introduce a recent set of methods (*sample splitting*, *stability selection* and the *knockoff filter*) that allow to identify the truly important predictors with rigorous statistical guarantees.
